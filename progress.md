# Write down progess here, things implemented, blockers, etc. Use this as a living breathing context document for tasks and updated plans / things to be aware of.

## Docs alignment (spec/rules)
- Aligned `technical_spec.md` with `rules_draft.md`: added round/lead tracking, VP privacy in views, champion limit + cost scaling, round-cap tiebreaker, hand-limit overflow behavior, market preview mapping, and clarified market tie-break roll-off.
- Updated `rules_draft.md`: clarified initiative placeholders, fixed market preview mapping, and defined lead rotation.
- Card defs in `technical_spec.md` now described as data-first (TS/JSON) with code resolver mapping.

## Open decisions
- Confirm preferred card data format: TS data modules vs JSON (both data-first).
