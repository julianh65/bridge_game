A list of actual changes to make to cards, their initiatives, champion costs, how many copies of them there are each.
I will format it in general as this
If I don't list a specific attribute it means that there are no changes
Starter deck cards will list their individual copies in order of:
bastion, assassins, mobile guys, miners, card mfs, bridge

A script will be run at the end that puts all the cards in their correct initiative order without gaps and highlight any conflicts / same initiatives

the initiatives will spawn 1-1000 based on what percentile roughly i think they should be
